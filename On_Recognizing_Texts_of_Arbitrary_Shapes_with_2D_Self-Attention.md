# On Recognizing Texts of Arbitrary Shapes with 2D Self-Attention
* __SATRN(Self-Attension Text Recognition Network)__ adopts the encoder-decoder construct of Transformer to address the cross-modality between the image input and the text output.<br><br>
* New modules to make Transformer effective and efficient for STR(Scene Text Recognition)<br>
  1) shallow CNN<br>
  2) adaptive 2D positional encoding<br>
  3) locality-aware feedforward layer<br>
